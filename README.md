This is a Discord chatbot powered by a local LLM. This is designed to use Google gemma-3-4b-it which can be found and obtained from here https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it. 
This is a simple chatbot that can be used by multiple people at a time. It uses the typing indicator to show when it is thinking. It will respond to any message and is meant to be used in a DM.
You will need to get a discord bot API key as well as download Google Gemma. This model is set up to run on the CPU given it is not super demanding and fast responses aren't needed.

Settup


You will need to apply gfor acces to google gemma then git clone it somewhere on your computer.
Within the code you will need to specify a few strings.
YOu need to give your discord bot token, name that the bot should be called, and the location of Gemma.
after that run the Setup.bat then the Run.bat and it should all be good.
